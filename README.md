[OUR README IS A VERY BASIC EXPLANATION. FOR THE DETAILS, READ THE WHITEPAPER AND POWERPOINT]
We propose a decentralised digital escrow system, which will be user friendly, secure and futureproof. 
Using the Tezos blockchain will allow us to make our product user-centred and efficent.
To see our whitepaper and presentaion, download the files we have commited in this repo.
We have also made a working beta of our escrow system, which is deployed on testnet.
Our project is applicable for the technical, non-tecnhical and idea challenges.
